							<p>So it begins. When I received the box for the Arduino starter kit I was expecting it to be a lot larger than it was. I was surprised when I opened it. Over half the box was packing material. Undeterred I opened up the box and started working on putting my board together and figuring out what the pieces were. I followed the instructions for putting the board together in the book and it wasn’t too difficult to figure out. I unfortunately forgot to take pictures of the process. After I got my board set up I started working on following the video for project 1 and making my first circuit. That is where I ran into my first difficulty.</p>

							<p>The project asked for a 220 Ohm resistor and I started looking at the big band of resistors for the right one. That’s when I realized that I had underestimated just how small these resistors are and just how difficult it would be to tell the color codes of the resistors apart. I am unfortunately red-green color blind. Normally I never run into problems with it in my everyday life however today it would come to haunt me as trying to figure out what colors the color bands of the resistors were supposed to be was impossible for me. Eventually, I resorted to asking my roommate to help me. As a temporary solution, I tried separating and labeling the resistor bands with their corresponding Ohms. I hope to be able to figure out a more permanent solution to that problem.</p>

							<p>Speaking of temporary solutions that require attention. I really need to get some way of organizing all of my Arduino stuff. There are a lot of small pieces of circuitry that I really don’t want to lose and I want to be able to easily put it all away after class so that I can use my desk for other work. For now, though I will have to survive with the chaos.</p>

							</p>In the end, though I got the circuit put together and the light turns on when I press the button which is oddly cooler than I would have thought. I look forward to making more complex circuits in the future. </p></span>
